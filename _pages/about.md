Hi! I am Sebastian, but I prefer my middle name, Tom. Currently, I recently graduated with a bachelors in Computer Engineering at California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB). I am incredibly grateful to be collaborating with Prof. Anjana Yatawara. I am principally interested in designing next-generation GPU architecture and pushing the boundaries for computational power and energy efficiency in state-of-the-art workloads. I am also interested in adversarial machine learning, developing attack and defense mechanisms. 

My research experience started as a junior in my undergrad, and can be attributed to the widespread encouragement of friends, family, and faculty. My first project involved modeling trends of air pollution-related disease as part of UC Merced's CV PATH experience. I continued undergraduate research under Prof. Yatawara, who has been integral in solidifying my ambition for a career in academia. My work focused on integrating LSTM recurrent neural networks into various GARCH models and evaluating their Influenza predictive performance against other models. I have also done research under Prof. Amin Malekmohammadi in developing AUTOBOTS - a defense mechanism against GPU kernel-based profiling attacks in deep learning. 

I have collaborated with colleague Martin Caballero on developing a modular guitar pedalboard as part of a senior capstone project. As part of my half of the project, I am creating a distortion pedal with a built-in noise gate. You can view the PCB for it [here!](https://tomregpala.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/)

I also have three years of experience as an information technology assistant on my campus, where I honed my skills in work documentation, collaboration, enterprise networking, and vulnerability remediation.

As part of a capstone senior project in my undergraduate studies, I am working alongside my colleague Martin Caballero on developing a modular pedalboard. The idea is to consolidate all of the secondary purchases associated with guitar effects pedalboards into a single, cost-effective module. The module can pass signal input/output, supply power, and act as a platform for the effects pedal.

For a prototype, the modules will support industry standard pedals. This means they will be sized to fit 1590B enclosure measurements, provide 9V center-negative polarity DC power. As part of the project, I am building a distortion pedal that represents an ideal standard:
